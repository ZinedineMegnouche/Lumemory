# LumenMemory

LumenMemory is a mobile application developed as part of my studies. Built with SwiftUI, it focuses on managing communication between an Apple Watch and an iPhone while also integrating HomeKit functionality to control smart home devices.

## Features

### HomeKit Management
- Add and manage smart home accessories directly from the app.
- Create and configure smart home environments ("Homes").
- Detect only compatible connected RGB lights to ensure proper game functionality.

### Simon Memory Game
- The app features a Simon-style memory game where an RGB lamp lights up with a color, and the player must tap the corresponding color on the iPhone or Apple Watch.
- Difficulty levels:
  - **Easy:** One light at a time between rounds.
  - **Medium:** Two lights per round.
  - **Hard:** Three lights per round.
- The sequence increases in complexity after each round.
- High-score system to track the best performances.
